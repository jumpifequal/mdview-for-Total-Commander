## Windows XP Build

The repository includes a dedicated `ReleaseXP|Win32` Visual Studio configuration that produces `mdview_xp.wlx`.

- It targets Windows XP SP3 with `_WIN32_WINNT=0x0501`
- It uses the XP-capable `v141_xp` toolset together with the legacy Windows SDK support installed in Visual Studio
- Mermaid rendering falls back to the original source block on XP for stability
- The XP build is 32-bit only

## Screenshots

> *TODO: Add screenshots of light mode, dark mode, split view, and Mermaid rendering.*

## Features

- **Full Markdown rendering** — headings, bold, italic, strikethrough, links, images, tables with column alignment, fenced and indented code blocks, blockquotes (nested), ordered and unordered lists, task lists, horizontal rules, autolinks, and escape sequences
- **Syntax highlighting** — JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C, C++, C#, Java, Rust, Go, SQL, Bash, CSS/SCSS, PHP, HTML, and XML
- **Built-in Mermaid diagrams** — self-contained support for `graph` / `flowchart`, `sequenceDiagram`, `classDiagram`, `stateDiagram`, and `stateDiagram-v2`
- **Consistent Mermaid typography** — supported Mermaid diagrams follow the active viewer font family and font size from MDView settings
- **Dark / light mode** — toggle with `Ctrl+D`, or auto-detected from the Windows theme on first launch
- **Adjustable layout** — zoom in and out, optionally constrain reading column width
- **Line numbers** — toggle on code blocks with `Ctrl+L`
- **Table of Contents** — auto-generated sidebar from headings
- **Find in page** — incremental search with match highlighting and navigation
- **Tooltip on links** — hovering a link shows the resolved target URL
- **Split view** — rendered Markdown alongside the raw Markdown source with `Ctrl+M`
- **Raw Markdown viewer** — implemented with the Windows RichEdit control using a configurable monospace font
- **Character count with spaces** — both rendered and raw views show a character count aligned to a Word-like convention that excludes line breaks
- **Scroll synchronisation** — rendered HTML and raw Markdown views stay aligned using ratio-based document scrolling
- **Smart clipboard behaviour**
  - Copy from rendered view → formatted HTML + plain text
  - Copy from raw view → original Markdown text
- **Expand / collapse** — long code blocks and blockquotes are collapsed by default with a "Show more" button
- **Persistent settings** — font size, theme, column width, line numbers, and raw view settings are saved and restored between sessions
- **Print support** — `Ctrl+P` renders a clean printable version
- **Progress bar** — subtle reading position indicator at the top of the viewport
- **Full window resize** — content fills the viewport correctly when the lister window is resized or maximised

## Mermaid Support

Mermaid rendering is built directly into the plugin and is fully self-contained inside the `.wlx` and `.wlx64` binaries. No external JavaScript files are required in the distribution.

Currently supported Mermaid diagram types:

- `graph` / `flowchart`
- `sequenceDiagram`
- `classDiagram`
- `stateDiagram`
- `stateDiagram-v2`

For the supported diagram types, MDView keeps Mermaid output aligned with the surrounding document typography and scales SVG output to fit the available preview width without pathological oversizing.

Unsupported Mermaid syntaxes fall back safely to the original source block instead of breaking the preview.

For the dedicated Windows XP build, Mermaid blocks fall back to the original source block instead of rendered diagrams. This keeps the XP target stable while preserving full Mermaid rendering on the modern Win32 and x64 builds.

## Download

Grab the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page. The distribution includes modern Win32 (`mdview.wlx`), x64 (`mdview.wlx64`), and Windows XP (`mdview_xp.wlx`) builds.

## Installation

### Automatic

Open the downloaded `.zip` file inside Total Commander. The included `pluginst.inf` triggers the automatic plugin installer.

### Manual

1. Extract `mdview.wlx` or `mdview.wlx64` to a directory of your choice.
2. In Total Commander open **Configuration → Options → Plugins → Lister (WLX) → Add**.
3. Select the `.wlx` / `.wlx64` file.
4. The detect string auto-configures for `.md`, `.markdown`, `.mkd`, and `.mkdn` extensions.

## Usage

1. Navigate to any Markdown file in Total Commander.
2. Press `F3` to open the lister.
3. Use the keyboard shortcuts to customise the view. Preferences are saved automatically.

For Mermaid validation, use `test_mermaid.md`. It covers the Mermaid diagram families currently supported by MDView. For a broad Markdown regression sample, use `test.md`.

## Building from Source

The plugin is implemented in a single C source file and can be built natively on Windows with MSVC.

The raw Markdown view uses the built-in **RichEdit (Msftedit.dll)** control available on modern Windows systems.

Visual Studio configurations:

- `Release|Win32` - modern 32-bit build (`mdview.wlx`)
- `Release|x64` - modern 64-bit build (`mdview.wlx64`)
- `ReleaseXP|Win32` - Windows XP-compatible 32-bit build (`mdview_xp.wlx`)

The `ReleaseXP|Win32` configuration targets `_WIN32_WINNT=0x0501` with the XP toolset and keeps the XP-specific fallbacks isolated in local compatibility helpers.

The project also includes `resource.rc` and `resource.h`, so the Win32, x64, and XP binaries embed Windows file version metadata directly.

## How It Works

MDView is a WLX lister plugin that Total Commander loads when you press `F3` on a matching file type. It contains a built-in Markdown-to-HTML converter and embeds an MSHTML WebBrowser control to render the output. Keyboard input is handled by subclassing the browser's internal window, giving reliable hotkey interception without interfering with normal scrolling or Total Commander key handling. The OLE control and its child window hierarchy are resized via `IOleInPlaceObject::SetObjectRects` and `MoveWindow` so the viewer fills the lister window at any size. Settings are persisted via the standard Total Commander INI mechanism.

## File List
